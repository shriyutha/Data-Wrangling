WRANGLE AND ANALYZE DATA:

INTRODUCTION:

    The dataset that I will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is WeRateDogs, tweet archive of Tweeter account using python (and it's libraries).

    And will document wrangling efforts in Jupyter Notebook.

    The WeRateDogs is a Tweeter account, that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

    These ratings almost have a denominator of 10.

    The numerators always greater than 10. Like 11/10, 15/10, etc...

    Because "they are good dogs Brent."  

    WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and recived international media coverage.

    WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for us to use in this project.

    This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, source, expanded_urls, name, etc...) for all 5000+ of their tweet as they stood on Auguest 1, 2017.   

    The main goal is to wrangle WeRateDogs Twitter data to create interesting and trustworthy analysis and visualizations.

    Need to do addtional gathering, then assesing and cleaning for worthy analysis and visualizations.
